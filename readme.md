## Overview

PixelShop is a fictitious gaming store created for my Code Institute Milestone 4 project. Built to demonstrate the key skills I have learnt including user login and registration, adding, editing and deleting products from the frontend, Stripe payments, and storing images with AWS.

The store isn't real, it is purely educational to show what I have managed to build while learning new technologies.
